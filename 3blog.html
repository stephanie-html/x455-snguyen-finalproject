              Up until recently, I never truly knew how to do master studies. I mean sure. You look up at the master’s painting, then down at your own. And you copy, trying to understand the motivations behind the original artist’s decisions. Why did he (or she) use this color? Why this edge? Why this composition? And from completing a master copy, you would come out with a fresh angle on how to make a picture, or so they say. Repeating this process was all well and good, and it sure gave me confidence boosts each time I completed one. But the process quickly became a nightmare. I found myself focusing on the wrong things; instead of looking at the bigger picture, I zeroed in on minute details, trying to copy exactly what I saw in front of me. They began taking ages and ages to do. And on top of it all, I could never truly apply the lessons I learned to my own illustrations.  
              </p>

              <p><strong>Then I had my "Aha" moment.</strong></p>

              After much frustration with trying to copy every detail from master paintings, I decided to switch things up. My time spent studying old artwork would be rephrased as “me making my own personal illustration while referencing a master painting.” This relieved me of the pressure to make an exact copy of a piece of artwork, and it allowed me to have more fun while doing my studies. My paintings of choice were usually portraits or a subject placed in a simple environment. I began to caricature and heavily simplify the subjects and focus purely on color, composition, and value structures. I stopped paying much mind to rendering, only when I felt it was necessary. Because I was essentially reinterpreting the master painting into something simpler yet similar, I learned so much more about the original artist’s intentions and about my own. And because the illustrations I completed were half my own and half the original artist’s, I found it much easier to ease the lessons I learned into illustrations that were completely my own.
